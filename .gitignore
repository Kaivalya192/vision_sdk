#  Usually these files are created by PyInstaller.
#  You may want to keep some of them if you are working on a single file plugin
#  like a PySide plugin. In this case, you will need to edit .gitignore to ignore

#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   from different sources is a concern, you may want to ignore Pipfile.lock.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to keep poetry.lock in version control.
